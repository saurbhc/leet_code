# (if n denotes to counts of numbers in nums)
# Time Complexity: O(n)
# ... In each iteration, search and insertion of the hash set both takes
# ... O(logn) time in worst case and O(1) time in average cases
# ... Therefore, itâ€™s takes O(n * (2logn)) = O(nlogn) time in worst case
# ... but O(n) time in average cases.
# Space Complexity: O(n)
# ... it uses O(n) extra space for maintaining this hash set
